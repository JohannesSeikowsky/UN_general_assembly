#### Use
`git clone https://github.com/JohannesSeikowsky/UN_general_assembly.git`

#### Converting PDFs
I added a script to convert the pdfs that were downloaded into the "pdfs" directory
into text files. To use it, create a directory named "txts" in the project direcory.
Then run the "convert_pdfs_to_txts.py" script with python3.
